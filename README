Have you ever wished you could control your Roku player from the terminal of your computer?

I have. This shell script lets you do just that, and it uses keybindings!

You can either run this script directly or  add these functions to your ~/.profile or ~/.bash_rc file and type

roku

Enjoy :)

You can use the original if you want VIM keybindings. :) https://github.com/joecannatti/BashRokuRemote
